### <p style="text-align: center;">Deciphering-Seismology: A repository of seismology mini-projects</p>
<br>
<br>

This is a my passion project- a repository of modularised python codes to solve seismological problems. Each `mini-project` contains a `README` file, an `Example.ipynb` file to demonstrate each mini project, and the `*.py` file which contains the scratch implementation of all the projects.
<br>

Check out all the mini-projects uploaded in this repo.
