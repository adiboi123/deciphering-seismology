### <p style="text-align: center;">Deciphering-Seismology: A repository of seismology mini-projects</p>
<br>
<br>

This project is a repository of modularised python source codes to solve specific seismological problems. Each `mini-project` contains a `README` file that summarises the approach for solving the problem statement, an `Example.ipynb` file that provides an executable to demonstrate the solution for resolving the problem statement and the `*.py` file which contains a library of the source files for the solution.

Check out all the mini-projects uploaded in this repo.
