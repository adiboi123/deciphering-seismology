This is a demonstration of window-method declustering of any seismic catalogue. `Window_Method.ipynb` uses a synthetic catalogue: `Synthetic_Catalogue.csv` to demonstrate the window method algorithm (*Gardner & Knopoff, 1972*):<br>

The objective of this project is to create a declustering function from scratch that will take seismic catalogue dataframe as input and separate it into *Mainshocks* and *Aftershocks* as per time and distance windows. Though the original paper discusses about depth-windows too, this has not been implemented in the code. The function `window_declustering()` creates a dataframe from the input dataframe containing the catalogue, containg a "Remarks" column to classify the Mainshocks and Aftershocks.

Check out the documentation and use-cases of the functions in the `Window_Method.ipynb` file.
